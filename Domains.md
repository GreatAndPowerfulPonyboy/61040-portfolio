### Flashcards (Selected)
When I first started researching better ways to study in high school, I was inundated with videos explaining how typical flashcard usage was actually hurting knowledge retention. Said videos explained that the general usage of flash cards and other active recall tools, while better than just doing nothing or pure note-taking, did not typically promote higher-order learning as described by Bloom's Taxonomy. While I'd love to be able to fix these bad habits in myself, I find that the cognitive load of creating study materials that truly hurt my brain to promote greater retention can be daunting when I'm left to my own devices.
### Learning things online (Selected)
From the mountains of online resources dedicated to teaching specific skills, there's clearly a demand for a more academic and bottom-up approach to skill acquisition. On my own, I've explored the idea of maximizing automaticity and have been intrigued by ways to make online learning more pedagogical by sacrificing some entertainment value for quicker skill acquisition.
### Productivity 
I'm generally unsatisfied with most productivity systems that are on the market, mainly due to them giving too much trust to the user and not leveraging social pressures to their utmost.

# Life Stuff

### Exercise
Like most people who exercise and also use the internet, I often find myself overburdened with choice on specific workouts in the noise of online engagement farming. Somehow, the best advice in the big '25 is still to find a random plan on Reddit and put it in your notes app.

### Socialization
While Omegle was kind of a mistake, I do think there's a place online besides just discord for spontaneous face-to-face communication, but I'm uncertain on how to square the clear need with necessary safety concerns. 
# Hobbies

### Indie Animation
I love independent animation, but I find that social media does a bad job of promoting them in an authentic manner. I'd love to have a place that helped collect more underground works without feeling like I'm being suffocated once an algorithm found something that 'clicked'.

### Fanfiction (Selected)
In my free time, I like reading or in more rare circumstances writing fanfiction. I tend to use fandom-specific sites, however, because fanfiction.net looks out of date and I abhor ao3's tagging system and middling recommendation system. I'd like to find a way to create a more modern experience while still maintaining ease of use for oldheads accustomed to the main websites.

### Music practice
I like practicing my instrument, and I'm a fan enough of technology that I'd love to find ways to augment my practice with digital tools. However, I find that for instruments that aren't the guitar or piano, (i play the trombone) there aren't nearly as many apps or products designed to improve practice.

### Video Games
I'm a huge fan of competitive video games, but I'm not a fan of when the competitive game stops being a fun display of mastery and starts turning into a skinner box of rage and frustration. Thus, I'm interesting in exploring how to signal the points, according to a community, in which a game stops being fun.

### Text-based Roleplay
I spent a lot of my formative years engaging in online roleplay using a text-based rpg engine. While the online tools for tabletop have advanced, purely text-based tools have stagnated. I'd love to have a more modern approach to MUD-like roleplay.
