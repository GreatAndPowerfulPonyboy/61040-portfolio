# Flashcards

### Enforcing higher-order thinking (Selected)
Once I start making a bunch of flash cards, I find that I've commonly just created a bunch of problems for a future me to solve and discarded any present learning. I'd love if the tools I used forced me to justify even the creation of notes for a specific piece of knowledge.
*I selected this because in my eyes it's the root of the other problems I've considered in the space. Once users are forced to think more about the information they choose to store and how they choose to test themselves on it, they'll more easily create loops of instrinic motivation that increases accountability. Moreover, by having to justify each step of the learning process, the mountain of cards problem will be prevented implicitly.* 

### Enforcing accountability
Most flashcard apps don't have very strong ways of incentivizing user accountability besides gameification. While gameification is useful, users like me who don't find it very enticing could be more interested in more heavy handed ways of enforcing user accountability, like the explicit productivity contracts of websites like beeminder or stickk. 
*I chose not to select this problem because the set of people interested in trying a new flashcard app are more likely to be more self directed and instrinsically motivated, so creating systems that bind them further might lead to more annoyance than benefit.*

### Return experience
Like everyone else who has ever created flashcards, I've eventually ignored them for an extended period of time and reached the point where hopping back on was too daunting. While preexisting tools have hopped on to ways to make this less jarring by obfuscating the amount of cards you have to catch up on, I wish they more intelligently discovered cards that would more quickly lead to remembering others. 
*I chose not to select this problem since I'm not too annoyed by the general solution of obfuscating how many cards a user has left.*


# Learning things online

### Lack of clear stepping stones(Selected)
For someone used to academic institutions, the best part of them is that they clearly define learning objectives and emphasize how one topic leads to the next. In most cases, online learning lacks the granularity of pedagogy, leading to people like me feeling directionless and drowning in tutorial after tutorial. 
*I chose to select this because in my eyes this is THE problem of online learning. Online resources provide a great top-down approach to create motivation and interest, but online incentive structures make users feed into dopamine loops instead of finding the clearest path to their destination*
### Lack of Coaching/Mentorship
From my music background, I know how transformative private lessons can be to the learning experience, but most online coaching and mentorship tools are either inundated with scams or heavily focused toward academic tutoring. It'd be great if I and others could get vetted coaching in both hobbies and academics.
*I chose not to tackle this problem because actually implemeting a solution comes with headaches beyond technical. Setting up a coach verification system can lead to a mountain of administrative headaches that I as a theoretical solo dev wouldn't be suited to handling.*

### Lack of required commitment
Self-directed learning is a double-edged sword amde sharper by the sheer volume of information online. You can spend days going from tutorial to tutorial because there's nothing forcing you to follow a specified path. 
*Similar to the flash card version of this problem, the user base I'd be targetting would be more likely to get annoyed by the heavy handedness than feel empowered.*
# Fanfiction websites

#### Finding good fanfics (Selected)
When my personally vetted authors haven't released updates, I find myself wasting precious time separating the wheat from the chaff before generally just rereading something I already like. For many fandoms, there are Reddit posts and the like describing some all-time greatest hits, but those feel like a band-aid solution for what is ultimately a problem of technology. I always feel like there's still some absolute gold that I'm missing that could be solved with modern recommendation tools.
*This is the most glaring problem in the typical fanfiction site. Current sorting systems are too unintelligent to differentiate between good works and things that've just lasted long enough to farm user engagement, creating hours of wasted time.*
### Ancient UI
Besides Wattpad, most fanfiction websites kinda pride themself on their more traditional UI. While I also appreciate more simple UX, sites like fimfiction have certainly drawn me toward them more often due to having a masterful mix of good aesthetic appeal while maintaining a strong user experience. 
*I chose not to focus on this problem because the user base for a fanfiction website are not only used to older UI styles, but they are likely to be actively against modern UI 'slop'*
### Collecting Canon
There are plenty of videos where people discuss almost canonical fanworks, the ones that dominated websites and created their own subcultures within a subculture. It'd be great if that recognition and historical mapping of said works were embedded into websites themselves to increase the tight-knit community aspect that helps keep me and other readers coming back to our specific fandom spaces.
*I chose not to focus on this problem because compared to the effort to implement it, it probably won't matter even to the specific user base that I'm targeting, who are most likely perfectly find discovering recursive fanfiction on their own*
