#### Domain
Flashcards. I've always liked having flashcards as part of my study system because they're the simplest way to incorporate both active recall and spaced repetition. However, I find that regardless of what application I use, the flashcards I make very rarely engage my brain so that I actually encode more information. I feel like there has to be a better way of leveraging this highly intuitive active recall tool to better optimize my and others' learning, but I'm not sure how. 
### Problem
**Lower Order Learning** An inherent issue with flashcards as a study tool is that they're more geared toward lower orders of learning. They are great for recalling facts and explaining ideas, but require creative use to encourage users to utilize them as a prompt to create connections or evaluate information. This rote memorization is also the root of users having a flashcard backlog, as information that could've been condensed in a higher-order learning cue to draw connections between ideas is instead spread into multiple lower-order learning cues for remembering each individual idea.
### Stakeholders
*Experienced flash card using students(No stranger to things like Anki or other tools on the market). Casual flash card using students(Used to physical cards or Quizlet) Educators(Use flash card tools like Quizlet to help students learn concepts). Learning youtubers looking for something exciting to recommend and also flex their expertise in. Impacts: Both students suffer from the lower-order learning outcomes of flash cards as a recall technique, but experienced users suffer more from the system's limitations due to increased experience. Moreover, the students more used to Quizlet or physical flash cards may have a stake in the system being less customizable and more plug and play, while the experienced student may want the opportunity ot have a more tailored experience at the cost of a higher learning curve,making the two at odds. Educators might be wary of any flash card system that might have AI augmentation due to its potential for cheating, and may have a stake in whatever system the students use being more limited in scope. The content creator may have a similar vested interest as the experienced student because a more complex system has a greater opportunity to create videos on, and that complexity may also help turn the casual user turned away from the sharper learning curve to watch their content specifically.*
