Maya, a college sophomore, opens BloomDeck the week before her biology midterm. On the Home page, she clicks “Create Card” and is brought to a page with a Bloom’s Taxonomy pyramid. Instead of letting her type any arbitrary definition card, BloomDeck requires her to choose a template tied to a Bloom’s level. She clicks the Analyze level and picks a comparison template, filling it out for mitosis vs. meiosis and innate vs. adaptive immunity. By design, she is encouraged to make higher order learning cards due to UI features emphasizing the pinnacle of the pyramid. Furthermore, she works together with Ai assistance to pick a template that pushes her to build flash cards that involve comparing, applying, or evaluating. Liking the AI's suggested templates for mitosis vs meiosis, she produces a card with it. However, she doesn't like the suggested templates for innate vs adaptive immunity, and instead creates her own template following manual suggestions on how to create an analyze level card. Back on the Home page, she tags her new cards “Cell Biology” and “Immunology,” ensuring that her study sets group concepts by theme rather than by isolated terms.

When she starts a study session, BloomDeck shows her the Front of Card cue, then flips to the Back with the response and asks how difficult it was to recall. Her choice adjusts the review schedule through Spaced Repetition, surfacing hard cards sooner. Over time, the interplay of templating and tagging changes her study habits: instead of reinforcing surface-level recall, her cards consistently ask her to connect ideas, and the tags let her study them in meaningful clusters. Later, on the Analytics page, she sees her daily streak, total study time, and which tags are most often missed. As part of her study system, she makes sure to go back into her textbook to review the concepts she commonly misses.
