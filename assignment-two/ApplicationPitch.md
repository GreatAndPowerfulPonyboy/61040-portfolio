## **BloomDeck Pitchdeck**
**Motivation**
Most flashcard apps only train rote memorization, leaving students without tools to build deeper understanding or track how their knowledge improves over time.

**Key Features**

**Bloom Levels** – Each flashcard must be tagged to a level of Bloom’s Taxonomy, from remembering facts to analyzing and evaluating ideas. Moreover, these levels will be type checked to some extent using AI evaluation. This means a user cannot have a card tagged as justify that just asks what a fact is, and not why it's important. This pushes learners beyond rote memorization, helping them practice higher-order thinking and better prepare for real-world applications. This impacts casual students by creating more friction between the creation of new cards, which may turn them away. However, this can be a boon to students experienced with other flashcard tools because it helps lock in their learning system. 

**Bloom Templates** - Besides creating their own setups for cues, users can select from a series of cue templates based on what level of bloom's taxonomy they want a card to hit. This helps lower the problem of lower-order learning by limiting user freedom in higher-order cards to have cues that optimize for the drawing of connections between topics as opposed to rote memorization. This benefits the casual student the most because it provides them with a hook to avoid the potential learning curve of a new system. 

**Bloom Tracking/Consolidation** - The bloom level composition of a user's card deck will be compiled, and if a user has an excess of lower-level cards, an AI recommendation will prompt them with a potential card to consolidate the lower-level cards into a higher level one. (I.e a bunch of cards about facts consolidated into an evaluation or compare and contrast). For the casual student, they may not balk at the consolidation of their cards, but a more experienced student or an educator, who likely have stronger opinions on their studying systems, may see it as an overreach.
