## **BloomDeck Pitchdeck**
**Motivation**
Most flashcard apps only train rote memorization, leaving students without tools to build deeper understanding or track how their knowledge improves over time.
**Key Features**
Bloom Levels – Each flashcard can be tagged to a level of Bloom’s Taxonomy, from remembering facts to analyzing and evaluating ideas. Moreover, these levels will be type checked to some extent using AI evaluation. This means a user cannot have a card tagged as justify that just asks what a fact is, and not why it's important. This pushes learners beyond rote memorization, helping them practice higher-order thinking and better prepare for real-world applications.
Bloom Templates - Besides creating their own setups for cues, users can select from a series of cue templates based on what level of bloom's taxonomy they want a card to hit.
Bloom Tracking - The bloom level composition of a user's card deck will be compiled, and if a user has an excess of lower-level cards, an AI recommendation will prompt them with a potential card to consolidate the lower-level cards into a higher level one. (I.e a bunch of cards about facts consolidated into an evaluation or compare and contrast)
