### Evidence for clearer stepping stones
[Automaticity is proven in reading and learning spaces](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8559868/) but hasn't been a clear focus in learning hobby skills, as they usually get more abstract pieces of advice, a clear need to be fulfilled.

[A Mathematician's lament](https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician%27s_Lament.pdf) Is actually a detractment of this idea in the mathematics field, but is a key evidence toward the opinion of one of my key stakeholders, educators, toward the bottom-up style my software would focus on in hobbies. This serves as a reference in how to maintain the instrinsic motivation of students and not just maximize pedagogy.

[bigboxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=343EWZS9O88) Escaping tutorial hell is a common issue of programmers, and its pitfalls and potential solutions I believe are not restricted to the progamming discipline and could be adapted for a vast suite of hobbies.

[The Math Academy Way](https://www.justinmath.com/files/the-math-academy-way.pdf) Is a case study in how an online educator used automaticity and knowledge graphs, the kind of stepping stones I want to extend, to not only magnify in person pedagogy, but also to create a popular, albeit in niche spheres, online course in mathematics fundamentals, which shows one way this need has been fulfilled in a specific niche that i could extrapolate to a more overarching resource.

[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) is a popular website for those learning to be software engineers famed for how clearly it lays out the fundamental skills to become job-ready. While this focuses highly on SWE, there's no reason professionals in other fields wouldn't be interested in similar tools to reach the need of having a clear pathway to improvement.

[Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/) is an online course tool tuned more toward the hobbyists to get a taste of how the best became the best, but suffers from limited course selection because of its necessity of 'expert' instruction.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) Is a popular online learning tool, but is more connected to those who already have direction, meaning I could fulfill more of a role of directing the directionless toward its courses.

[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) is a fundamentals course for hobby and professional artists, and the over 10k users in the website's discord show the success of more pedagogical online learning resources toward hobbies.

### Evidence for better fanfic search
[AO3 search PSA on r/AO3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/z0amkx/psa_searching_ao3/). This post shows a clear indication of dissatisfaction even within more dedicated users of AO3 (people on the subreddit) toward the nature of its search, demonstrating need.

[Handy danday AO3 search guide](https://www.tumblr.com/backofthebookshelf/618945087408390144/your-handy-guide-to-ao3-searching-and-filtering) While a useful tool for AO3 users, a user creating a guide for how to use the search feature is another clear indication that experienced users find the search cumbersome.

[R/fanfiction discussion on finding good fanfic](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/ydunqc/when_people_say_they_cant_find_anything_good_to/) Another discussion among more dedicated users on the difficulty of separating the wheat from the chaff considering fanfic's low barrier to entry

[r/Fanfiction discussion on ff.net search](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/zgha17/how_do_you_actually_search_for_fics_on_ffn/) Demonstrates that among experienced and inexperienced users alike, issues with search are not limited to ao3, but are pervasive among sites

[Scryer, open source fanfiction search engine](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Scryer_(fanfiction_search_engine)) A previous attempt on innovating within the space, but didn't reach wide engagement due to its limitation to fanfiction.net and the necessity of needing large scrapes, which can be circumvented by just having the search as part of its own website

[Good fanfic search guide for FF.net](https://catonthebookshelf.wordpress.com/2018/01/25/how-to-find-good-fanfiction-on-fanfiction-net/) Yet another blog offering assistance toward crafting your own improved search queries instead of being able to leverage clear tools within existing websites

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) Most notable book recommendation website, leveraging both algorithmic tools and user reviews that haven't been very well integrated in the fanfiction space to benefit inexperienced users, who are probably more used to goodreads' style

[r/Litrpg thread on issues with Amazon's search](https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/14uvd1f/amazon_antirecommendations_want_to_continue_a/) Demonstrates that for spheres closer to the fandom space like LitRPGs, Amazon's recent recommendation system also isn't very robust.

### Evidence for emphasizing higher-order learning in flash cards
[Harvard description of bloom's taxonomy for learning objectives](bokcenter.harvard.edu/taxonomies-learning) Academic proof of the effectiveness of bloom's taxonomy of a paradigm, which could be leveraged in non-academic contexts.

[Bloom's taxonomy learning objectives](https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/) Another academic look into the effectiveness of the paradigm.

[Youtube video on the drawback of flashcards, as stated by a PhD in education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGrHI353no) Clearly outlines the current failure conditions of flashcards as learning tools

[Article on flashcard hell](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/11/01/flashcard-hell/) Rearticulates a common failure condition with flashcards to an audience mixed iwth experienced and inexperienced learners

[Remnote](https://www.remnote.com/) Online flashcard tool that I've used myself that integreates spaced repetition and active recall tools, but doesn't stop the user from creating the 'wrong' cards

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Flashcard system famed for its best in class spaced repitition system, but also for its common hell condition of having tons of cards to catch up on, which is a problem I could try to solve in my product

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/features/flashcards) Common flash card app used by educators, recently criticized for locking too many features behind a paywall.

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) Popular learning app geared toward casual language learners, criticized for haphazard use of AI tools and learning ineffectiveness.

[Cognitive Load Theory Overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-load-theory) Description of a learning framework emphasizing using the difficulty of cognitive overload to increase performance and learning, which can be facilitated with more strict adherence to bloom's taxonomy in flashcards to benefit experienced learners.
